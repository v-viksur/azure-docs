# Use the Azure portal to restore virtual machines
Protect your data by taking snapshots of your data at defined intervals. These snapshots are known as recovery points, and they're stored in Recovery Services vaults. If it's necessary to repair or rebuild a virtual machine (VM), you can restore the VM from any of the saved recovery points. When you restore a recovery point, you can:

* Create a new VM, which is a point-in-time representation of your backed-up VM.
* Restore disks, and use the template that comes with the process to customize the restored VM, or do an individual file recovery. 

This article explains how to restore a VM to a new VM or restore all backed-up disks. For individual file recovery, see [Recover files from an Azure VM backup](backup-azure-restore-files-from-vm.md).

![Three ways to restore from VM backup](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/azure-vm-backup-restore.png)

> [!NOTE]

Restoring a VM or all disks from VM backup involves two steps:

* Select a restore point for restore.
* Select the restore type, create a new VM or restore disks, and specify the required parameters. 

## Select a restore point for restore
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/).

2. On the Azure menu, select **Browse**. In the list of services, type **Recovery Services**. The list of services adjusts to what you type. When you see **Recovery Services vaults**, select it.

    ![Recovery Services vault](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/open-recovery-services-vault.png)

    The list of vaults in the subscription is displayed.

    ![List of Recovery Services vaults](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/list-of-rs-vaults.png)
3. From the list, select the vault associated with the VM you want to restore. When you select the vault, its dashboard opens.

    ![Selected Recovery Services vault](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/select-vault-open-vault-blade.png)
4. In the vault dashboard, on the **Backup Items** tile, select **Azure Virtual Machines**.

    ![Vault dashboard](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/vault-dashboard.png)

    The **Backup Items** blade opens and displays the list of Azure VMs.

    ![List of VMs in vault](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/list-of-vms-in-vault.png)
5. From the list, select a VM to open the dashboard. The VM dashboard opens to the monitoring area, which contains the **Restore points** tile.

    ![Restore points](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/vm-blade.png)
6. On the VM dashboard menu, select **Restore**.

    ![Restore button](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/vm-blade-menu-restore.png)

    The **Restore** blade opens.

    ![Restore blade](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/restore-blade.png)
7. On the **Restore** blade, select **Restore point**. The **Select restore point** blade opens.

    ![Select restore point](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/recovery-point-selector.png)

    By default, the dialog box displays all the restore points from the last 30 days. Use the **Filter** to alter the time range of the restore points displayed. By default, restore points of all consistencies are displayed. Modify the **All restore points** filter to select a specific restore point consistency. For more information about each type of restoration point, see [Data consistency](backup-azure-vms-introduction.md#data-consistency).

    Restore point consistency options:

     * Crash consistent restore points
     * Application consistent restore points
     * File-system consistent restore points
     * All restore points

8. Choose a restore point, and select **OK**.

    ![Restore point options](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/select-recovery-point.png)

    The **Restore** blade shows that the restore point is set.

9. If you're not already there, go to the **Restore** blade. Ensure that a [restore point is selected](#select-restore-point-for-restore), and select **Restore configuration**. The **Restore configuration** blade opens.

## Choose a VM restore configuration
After you select the restore point, choose a VM restore configuration. To configure the restored VM, you can use the Azure portal or PowerShell.

1. If you're not already there, go to the **Restore** blade. Ensure that a [restore point is selected](#select-restore-point-for-restore), and select **Restore configuration**. The **Restore configuration** blade opens.

    ![Restore configuration wizard](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/recovery-configuration-wizard-recovery-type.png)
2. On the **Restore configuration** blade, you have two choices:

   * **Create virtual machine**

   * **Restore disks**

The portal provides a **Quick Create** option for a restored VM. To customize the VM configuration or the names of the resources created as part of creating a new VM choice, use PowerShell or the portal to restore backed-up disks. Use PowerShell commands to attach them to your choice of VM configuration. Or you can use the template that comes with restored disks to customize the restored VM. For information on how to restore a VM that has multiple NICs or is under a load balancer, see [Restore a VM with special network configurations](#restore-vms-with-special-network-configurations). If your Windows VM uses [HUB licensing](../virtual-machines/windows/hybrid-use-benefit-licensing.md), restore disks and use PowerShell/Template as specified in this article to create the VM. Make sure that you specify the **License Type** as "Windows_Server" while you create the VM to avail HUB benefits on the restored VM. 
 
## Create a new VM from a restore point
1. If you're not already there, [select a restore point](#restore-a vm-with-special-network-configurations) before you begin to create a new VM from a restore point. After you select a restore point, on the **Restore configuration** blade, enter or select values for each of the following fields:

    a. **Restore Type**. Create a virtual machine.

    b. **Virtual machine name**. Provide a name for the VM. The name must be unique to the resource group (for an Azure Resource Manager-deployed VM) or cloud service (for a classic VM). You can't replace the VM if it already exists in the subscription.

    c. **Resource group**. Use an existing resource group or create a new one. If you're restoring a classic VM, use this field to specify the name of a new cloud service. If you're creating a new resource group/cloud service, the name must be globally unique. Typically, the cloud service name is associated with a public-facing URL: for example, [cloudservice].cloudapp.net. If you attempt to use a name for the cloud resource group/cloud service already in use, Azure assigns the resource group/cloud service the same name as the VM. Azure displays resource groups/cloud services and VMs not associated with any affinity groups. For more information, see [How to migrate from affinity groups to a regional virtual network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-migrate-to-regional-vnet.md).

    d. **Virtual network**. Select the virtual network when you create the VM. The field provides all virtual networks associated with the subscription. The resource group of the VM is displayed in parentheses.

    e. **Subnet**. If the virtual network has subnets, the first subnet is selected by default. If there are additional subnets, select the subnet you want.

    f. **Storage Account**. This menu lists the storage accounts in the same location as the Recovery Services vault. Storage accounts that are zone redundant aren't supported. If there are no storage accounts with the same location as the Recovery Services vault, you must create one before you start the restore operation. The storage account's replication type is displayed in parentheses.

    ![Restore configuration wizard](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/recovery-configuration-wizard.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > * If you restore a Resource Manager-deployed VM, you must identify a virtual network. A virtual network is optional for a classic VM.

    > * If you restore VMs with managed disks, make sure that the storage account selected isn't enabled for Azure Storage Service Encryption in its lifetime.

    > * Based on the storage type of the storage account selected (premium or standard), all disks restored will be either premium or standard disks. We currently don't support a mixed mode of disks when restoring.
    >
    >

2. On the **Restore configuration** blade, select **OK** to finalize the restore configuration. On the **Restore** blade, select **Restore** to trigger the restore operation.

## Restore backed-up disks
To customize the VM you want to create from backed-up disks different from what is present in the **Restore configuration** blade, select **Restore disks** as the value for **Restore Type**. This choice asks for a storage account where disks from backups are to be copied. When you choose a storage account, select an account that shares the same location as the Recovery Services vault. Storage accounts that are zone redundant aren't supported. If there are no storage accounts with the same location as the Recovery Services vault, you must create one before you start the restore operation. The storage account's replication type is displayed in parentheses.

After the restore operation is finished, you can:

* [Use the template to customize the restored VM](#use-templates-to-customize-restore-vm)
* [Use the restored disks to attach to an existing VM](../virtual-machines/windows/attach-managed-disk-portal.md)
* [Create a new VM by using PowerShell from restored disks](./backup-azure-vms-automation.md#restore-an-azure-vm)

On the **Restore configuration** blade, select **OK** to finalize the restore configuration. On the **Restore** blade, select **Restore** to trigger the restore operation.

![Recovery configuration completed](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/trigger-restore-operation.png)

## Track the restore operation
After you trigger the restore operation, the backup service creates a job for tracking the restore operation. The backup service also creates and temporarily displays the notification in the **Notifications** area of the portal. If you don't see the notification, select the **Notifications** symbol to view your notifications.

![Restore triggered](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/restore-notification.png)

To view the operation while it's processing, or to view it when it's finished, open the **Backup jobs** list.

1. On the Azure menu, select **Browse**, and in the list of services, type **Recovery Services**. The list of services adjusts to what you type. When you see **Recovery Services vaults**, select it.

    ![Open Recovery Services vault](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/open-recovery-services-vault.png)

    The list of vaults in the subscription is displayed.

    ![List of Recovery Services vaults](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/list-of-rs-vaults.png)
2. From the list, select the vault associated with the VM you restored. When you select the vault, its dashboard opens.

3. In the vault dashboard on the **Backup Jobs** tile, select **Azure virtual machines** to display the jobs associated with the vault.

    ![Vault dashboard](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/vault-dashboard-jobs.png)

    The **Backup jobs** blade opens and displays the list of jobs.

    ![List of VMs in a vault](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/restore-job-in-progress.png)
    
## Use templates to customize a restored VM
After the [restore disks operation is finished](#Track-the-restore-operation), use the template that was generated as part of the restore operation to create a new VM with a configuration different from the backup configuration. You also can use it to customize names of resources that were created during the process of creating a new VM from a restore point. 

> [!NOTE]
> Templates are added as part of restore disks for recovery points taken after March 1, 2017. They're applicable for nonmanaged disk VMs. Support for managed disk VMs is coming in upcoming releases. 
>
>

To get the template that was generated as part of the restore disks option:

1. Go to the restore job details corresponding to the job.

2. On the **Restore Job Details** screen, select **Deploy Template** to initiate template deployment. 

     ![Restore job drill-down](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/restore-job-drill-down.png)
   
3. On the **Deploy template** blade for custom deployment, use template deployment to [edit and deploy the template](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-portal.md#deploy-resources-from-custom-template) or append more customizations by [authoring a template](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates.md) before you deploy. 

   ![Load template deployment](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/loading-template.png)
   
4. After you enter the required values, accept the **Terms and Conditions** and select **Purchase**.

   ![Submit template deployment](./media/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms/submitting-template.png)

## Post-restore steps
* If you use a cloud-init-based Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, for security reasons, the password is blocked post restore. Use the VMAccess extension on the restored VM to [reset the password](../virtual-machines/linux/reset-password.md). We recommend using SSH keys on these distributions to avoid resetting the password post restore.
* Extensions present during the backup configuration are installed, but they won't be enabled. If you see an issue, reinstall the extensions. 
* If the backed-up VM has static IP post restore, the restored VM has a dynamic IP to avoid conflict when you create a restored VM. Learn more about how you can [add a static IP to a restored VM](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-reserved-private-ip.md#how-to-add-a-static-internal-ip-to-an-existing-vm).
* A restored VM doesn't have an availability value set. We recommend using the restore disks option to [add an availability set](../virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-availability-sets.md) when you create a VM from PowerShell or templates by using restored disks. 


## Backup for restored VMs
If you restored a VM to the same resource group with the same name as the originally backed-up VM, backup continues on the VM post restore. If you restored the VM to a different resource group or you specified a different name for the restored VM, the VM is treated as if it's a new VM. You need to set up backup for the restored VM.

## Restore a VM during an Azure datacenter disaster
Azure Backup allows restoring backed-up VMs to the paired datacenter in case the primary datacenter where VMs are running experiences a disaster and you configured the backup vault to be geo-redundant. During such scenarios, select a storage account, which is present in a paired datacenter. The rest of the restore process remains the same. Backup uses the compute service from the paired geo to create the restored VM. For more information, see [Azure datacenter resiliency](../resiliency/resiliency-technical-guidance-recovery-loss-azure-region.md).

## Restore domain controller VMs
Backup of domain controller (DC) VMs is a supported scenario with Backup. However, you must be careful during the restore process. The correct restore process depends on the structure of the domain. In the simplest case, you have a single DC in a single domain. More commonly for production loads, you have a single domain with multiple DCs, perhaps with some DCs on-premises. Finally, you might have a forest with multiple domains. 

From an Active Directory perspective, the Azure VM is like any other VM on a modern supported hypervisor. The major difference with on-premises hypervisors is that there's no VM console available in Azure. A console is required for certain scenarios, such as recovering by using a bare-metal recovery (BMR)-type backup. However, VM restore from the backup vault is a full replacement for BMR. Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) is also available, so all Active Directory recovery scenarios are viable. For more information, see [Backup and restore considerations for virtualized domain controllers](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/virtual_active_directory_domain_controller_virtualization_hyperv(v=ws.10).aspx#backup_and_restore_considerations_for_virtualized_domain_controllers) and [Planning for Active Directory forest recovery](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/planning-active-directory-forest-recovery(v=ws.10).aspx).

### Single DC in a single domain
The VM can be restored (like any other VM) from the Azure portal or by using PowerShell.

### Multiple DCs in a single domain
When other DCs of the same domain can be reached over the network, the DC can be restored like any VM. If it's the last remaining DC in the domain, or a recovery in an isolated network is performed, a forest recovery procedure must be followed.

### Multiple domains in one forest
When other DCs of the same domain can be reached over the network, the DC can be restored like any VM. In all other cases, we recommend a forest recovery.

## Restore VMs with special network configurations
It's possible to back up and restore VMs with the following special network configurations. However, these configurations require some special consideration while going through the restore process:

* VMs under load balancers (internal and external)
* VMs with multiple reserved IPs
* VMs with multiple NICs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you create the special network configuration for VMs, you must use PowerShell to create VMs from the restored disks.
>
>

To fully re-create the VMs after restoring to disk, follow these steps:

1. Restore the disks from a Recovery Services vault by using [PowerShell](backup-azure-vms-automation.md#restore-an-azure-vm).

2. Create the VM configuration required for load balancer/multiple NIC/multiple reserved IP by using the PowerShell cmdlets. Use it to create the VM with the configuration you want:

   a. Create a VM in the cloud service with an [internal load balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/load-balancer-internal-getstarted/).

   b. Create a VM to connect to an [internet-facing load balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/load-balancer-internet-getstarted/).

   c. Create a VM with [multiple NICs](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-multiple-nics/).

   d. Create a VM with [multiple reserved IPs](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-reserved-public-ip/).
